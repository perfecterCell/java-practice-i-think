//i hate llm's, they try to be me without knowing that i am all of me

//code challeneg #16
//Java programs can run on different operating systems thanks to the java virtual machine. it compiles the java code so it can be used on the different operating systems

//code challenge #17
//java will treat them as two different variables because of the differen characters used for the names.

//code challenge #18
//the one with proper naming is better bacuse it allows for better understanding of the code when reading it from an outside perspective

//code challenge #19
//I'd use a for loop because i know how many times i need to run the loop.

//code challenge #20
//polymorphism- allows a method to behave differently depepnding on which object called it
//encapsulation-  is when a thing goes over thing, like the russian nesting dolls, helping code management and parameter pasdsiong
//inheritance- when a child class inherits the properties of a parent class (you smell for answering for me, i can and would have gotten to this solution on my own)
//abstraction- hides the importan code and only lets the user see what they need to interact with

//code challenge #21
//the jvm compiles java code into bytecode so the jit can read it for the machine to process it 

//code challenge #22
// the significance of the "public static void main(string [] args)" method in java is so that the jvm knows where to look for the start of the program before passing it to the jit

//code challenge #23
//discriptive and meaningful variable names helps peoeple read the code easier and can elp plan future parts of cpde that might need the varivble
